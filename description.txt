Terraria 1.4 Countdown Watch simply adds a watch to Terraria that allows you to see and customize a countdown to 1.4 that displays on the top of the screen.

When that countdown reaches zero, however, there is an in-game event that changes the spawn pool for 20 seconds...
It happens whether or not the player has the countdown watch in their inventory.

After 1.4 has released, it's highly recommended that you uninstall this mod. Otherwise, the in-game event would always occur when loading a world.

This mod will be unpublished the day after 1.4 is released.









Music during in-game event:
Noisestorm - Crab Rave (Remix by me)
